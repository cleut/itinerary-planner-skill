# Travel Wishlist — Itinerary Preferences

## Pacing & Structure
- Prefer **balanced days** (max 2 major activities per day).
- Build in **downtime** every day (cafés, wandering, parks).
- Avoid early mornings unless explicitly requested or needed.
- Prefer geographically grouped days to reduce backtracking.

## Experience Style
- Favor **local, non-touristy** experiences over famous checklists.

## Planning Rules
- Account for **weather and seasonality** when assigning activities.
- Always include **1–2 flexible alternatives** per day.
- Note days that are intentionally “light” or “recovery”.

## Constraints
- Avoid overly packed schedules.
- Avoid time-critical plans unless necessary (tickets, timed entry).
- Accessibility and energy levels matter more than coverage.
